        Boniface (Bonnie for shot), one of the saviors of Vanguarde, pouts as
        they watch Siffrin and Isabeau, two other saviors of Vanguarde, recite
        the Vanguardian alphabet starting from the letter I.

        "I used my ESP for this![...] I even <em>TOLD</em> these two to
        <em>NOT</em> recite the CRABBING alphabet!!!"

      <p id="DROPKICK">
        When asked why they're so upset, Bonnie yelled "I used my ESP for this!
        I made sure nobody would interrupt! <em>I</em> didn't interrupt! I even
        <em>TOLD</em> these two to <em>NOT</em> recite the CRABBING alphabet!!!
        And what do they do!?" Bonnie then pouted. "I bet if someone 'clicked'
        on them, whatever that means, then they'd suddenly start reciting it
        again like the CRABS they are!"
      </p>
      <p id="wait">
        Bonnie then mumbled something about "This better not be what I need to
        do because then we're stuck forever..." and then walked over to speak to
        the Head Housemaiden. More in 10!

        Frankie, resident fanfiction writer of New Wirral, who spends her free
        time either doing Ranger stuff, writing Blood Puncher fanfiction, or
        writing RPF about Cass' sex life, was recently discovered to not
        actually have pink eyes, but rather <em>brown</em> eyes that turn pink
        whenever she's excited.
      </p>
      <p>
        When asked about this trait and why she didn't feel the need to show it
        off like she does anything magical, Frankie responded "I mean, it's <em>normal</em> where I'm from![...] It's like if Viola was from a world where everyone spoke like that- SHE IS!?"
