        Boniface (Bonnie for shot), one of the saviors of Vanguarde, pouts as
        they watch Siffrin and Isabeau, two other saviors of Vanguarde, recite
        the Vanguardian alphabet starting from the letter I.

        <em>NOT</em> recite the CRABBING alphabet!!!"

      <p id="DROPKICK">
        When asked why they're so upset, Bonnie yelled "I used my ESP for this!
        I made sure nobody would interrupt! <em>I</em> didn't interrupt! I even
        <em>TOLD</em> these two to <em>NOT</em> recite the CRABBING alphabet!!!
        And what do they do!?" Bonnie then pouted. "I bet if someone 'clicked'
        on them, whatever that means, then they'd suddenly start reciting it
        again like the CRABS they are!"
      </p>
      <p id="wait">
        Bonnie then mumbled something about "This better not be what I need to
        do because then we're stuck forever..." and then walked over to speak to
        the Head Housemaiden. More in 10!

        Fangirl recently noticed to have color-changing eyes, says it's "not
        that big of a deal".

        "I mean, it's <em>normal</em> where I'm from![...] It's like if Viola

      <p>
        Frankie, resident fanfiction writer of New Wirral, who spends her free
        time either doing Ranger stuff, writing Blood Puncher fanfiction, or
        writing RPF about Cass' sex life, was recently discovered to not
        actually have pink eyes, but rather <em>brown</em> eyes that turn pink
        whenever she's excited.
      </p>
      <p>
        When asked about this trait and why she didn't feel the need to show it
        off like she does anything magical, Frankie responded "I mean, it's
        <em>normal</em> where I'm from![...] It's like if Viola was from a world
        where everyone spoke like that- SHE IS!?"
      </p>
      <p>Frankie was last seen showing off her magic eyeballs to everyone in New Wirral.</p>

      <h2>
        Interview with a Fucked-Up Not-Frankie: The inside scoop of the internal
        lives of beings that have our faces but aren't us
      </h2>
      <p>
        Fucked-Up Not-Frankie (FUNF for short): Follow my lead, partner-
      </p>
      <p>
        Interviewer (I for short): We're not here to fight.
      </p>
      <p>
        FUNF:...What? Is this a trick? Or... are you a new ally?
      </p>
      <p>
        I: We just want to interview you.
      </p>
      <p>
        FUNF: Interview? Oh! But I haven't defeated any great evils yet!
      </p>
      <p>
        I: We know. First question: How do you want to be referred as? 
      </p>
      <p>
        FUNF:...?
      </p>
      <p>
        I: Like... I'm not sure you're aware of this, really, but you're not the real Frankie. The real Frankie is showing off her magical eyeballs to everyone in New Wirral right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        FUNF: What a shocking reveal! The heroine learns the truth- she is a copy, a clone!
      </p>
      <p>
        I: So...
      </p>
      <p>
        FUNF: How will she bounce back from this reveal? How? How? How?
      </p>
      <p>
        I: Put- Put the recorder down! We're still interviewing!
      </p>
      <p>
        Magikrab (M for short): WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING!
      </p>
      <p>
        M: Are you <em>TRYING</em> to mess up the fucking canon?!
      </p>
      <p>
        M: Letting these fragments self-actualize is the FASTEST way to start fucking the <em>very fabric of reality</em> up!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        I:... Huh. You say fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
        I: I was expecting you to say "crab" instead of fuck for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        M: That's fucking stupid. Why would I-
      </p>
      <p>
        Just then, a Kid burst in!
      </p>
      <p>Child (C for short): SHUT YOUR CRAB FACE!!! STUPID CRAB!!! YOU'RE JUST ANGRY BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE!!!</p>
      <img src="System_menu_bonnie.png" width="100%">
      <p>(The child in question)</p>
      <p>I:... are you... completely monochrome?</p>
      <p>C: I don't know what that word MEANS! Also, WHY THE CRAB IS EVERYTHING WEIRD SHADES!?</p>
      <p>I: This interview is over.</p>
      <p>The Interviewer then ran out of the train, and has now been banned from the Mer-line by Magikrab and also the Mer-line itself. The Kid, whose name is Bonnie, however, has been permitted to beat up the Fucked-Up Not-People there, but is discouraged from using their fists.</p>
