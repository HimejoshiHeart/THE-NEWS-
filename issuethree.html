      <h1>Local Rogue 100% Ok, Don't Worry About Them.</h1>

      <p>
        Siffrin's trusted friends and companions noticed something off about
        them this morning as if they like. got the shit beat of them by the King
        repeatively and died and stuff.
      </p>
      <h2>
        "You think I'm in a... <i>timeloop?</i> A crabbing*
        <i>timeloop?</i> That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard!"
      </h2>
      <p>
        When questioned, Siffrin burst into laughter and said, in between bursts
        of laughter "You think I'm in a... <i>timeloop?</i> A crabbing*
        <i>timeloop?</i> That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard!"
      </p>
      <p>(It is important to note that nobody mentioned timeloops here.)</p>
      <p>
        Siffrin was last seen looking at the stars with a hungry look at their
        singular eye, as if they wanted to eat a star and have their head
        explode or something.
      </p>
      <p>
        *They didn't use the word 'crabbing' exactly, but the word they used is
        probably their culture's equivalent.

        After waking up from their nap in the meadow, Siffrin began to act
        weirdly depressed and zoned out.

      <p id="pain">
        Upon reporters asking them if they were ok, Siffrin was quoted as saying
        "...Yes. Very." in an Obviously Not Ok Way, as if they had repeated
        today and tomorrow about x times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Siffrin was last seen running towards the nearest planana peel- what are
        they doing-?!
